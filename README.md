# swift-KernelComposure
Swift app to parse MacOS kernel panic files.

With the release of macOS 10.15, the formatting of Kernel Panic logs has changed. What used to be able to be easily reviewed, now requires parsing. No need to panic, keep your composure with Encore's Kernel Composure and quickly pull the relevant information from your logs..

By default, only the basic information from the Kernel Panic log is shown. If you want to gather more information, you can select View -> Show Advanced from the top menu.
